review1.cs

- multiple responsiblities. session initialization and user exists is also checked in same method
checkPassword method name has to be CheckPassword
User check has to be there in separate method


Review2.cs
side effect is done here
name varibale is updated inside the method , which should not be done.

Review3.cs
rename the function name to DomNodeExist()

Review4.cs
no default handling in te switch case
polymorphism
return type are not proper.. or change method name accordingly 
magic numbers are used directly.
replace the magic numbers or hard coded values to constants

Review5
- avoid use of typeof()
- Gettype() is done in each if cases, aviod , get the type once in the begining
- move texas string to constant

Review6.cs

name of the method and responsibility is different.
change to meaning full name
bool can be removed by breaking to two methods.
CreateTempTouch(name) and Touch(name)


Review7.cs
avoid singleton as we can't mock

Review8.cs
multiple responsiblity variables 
cancellable can be moved to another method call
CreateMenu contains irrelevant parameters, CreateMenu can only accept menu names and create a menu.
instead of split of properties MenuItem type can be created and passed.

Review9.cs
Methos doing mucltiple checks and then sending mail, which is not correct. multiple responsiblity again.
split the responsibilty by FindClient(client);
then CheckActive in another method and then SendEmail
Method name can also be mamed as SendEmailToClients(string[] clients)
directly accessing the db, it's not using service

Review11.py
split logic into different methods naming.. validation, createCredential, createRespone()
wrong abstraction

Review12.cs
magic string

Review13.cs
remove dead code
